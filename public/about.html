<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a motivated and detail-oriented telecommunications engineering graduate with a strong academic foundation and a passion for emerging communication technologies. Throughout my university journey, I developed a solid understanding of wireless systems, network infrastructure, and signal processing. My educational background is complemented by hands-on projects and lab work that honed my technical skills and problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>In addition to my engineering knowledge, I bring strong interpersonal and communication skills, which enable me to work effectively in both team environments and independent settings. I have experience with tools and platforms such as MATLAB, Cisco Packet Tracer, and basic programming in Python and C. I’m also keen on exploring modern fields like IoT, 5G technologies, and voice recognition systems—areas where I continue to self-learn and grow.</p>

<p>As a recent graduate, I’m actively seeking entry-level roles where I can apply my knowledge, contribute to innovative projects, and continue building my skills. I am open to opportunities both in Jordan and the Gulf region, whether remote or on-site, and I’m excited to be part of a dynamic team that values innovation, collaboration, and continuous improvement.</p>
